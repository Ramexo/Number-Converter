# Number-Converter
This is a software that will convert numbers from one numbering system to another.

README

As stated before, this is a software that converts numbers from one numbering system to another. Its quite accurate but it can be greatly improved. I do considere it functional enough to post on github.

I also know that the way I wrote this code might not be most efficiant or effective, hell this whole code might be unecessary. But as you will read in comments if you do read them that this is my first big project that took me few days to complete.

Main goal for this project of mine was to learn about C through experience and struggle (I lear a lot when I get stuck) so yes all the code I written might be unecessary and there is probably a function in some library that does this far better.

At the end of the day, if you want to copy this code and use it as you see fit, you can. I dont considere this complex or that unique. If you want me to update this code to any changes you made I don't think I will, but I will accept any and all feedback as long as its not plain rudeness.
